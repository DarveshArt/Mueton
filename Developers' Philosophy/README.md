This folder explains the philosophy all developers need to refer before entering this endeavour.


For example, One of the most legendary victory of machine over man occurred in 1987. IBM’s tailor-made chess computer Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov, the most highly ranked player in the world. This was a landmark for AI.

Chess-playing computers shed little light on the question of mechanized cognition. They unashamedly rely on the ability of machines to consider hundreds of millions of moves per second. Kasparov can only examine a maximum of three moves per second. Deep Blue won using brute force, not brains.

Touting Deep Blue as a success amounts to Al putting its hands up and admitting lack of progress in replicating anything even approaching human cognition.

...


This lack of progress has led practitioners of Al to take stock. Are the current approaches to Al misguided, or are we just around the corner from a breakthrough? A number of researchers suspect the former, and have actively sought to re-orientate Al.

“… the cognitivistic paradigm’s neglect of the fact that intelligent agents live in a real physical world leads to significant shortcomings in explaining intelligence.” – Rolf Pfeifer and Christian Scheier

Sophia the robot’s co-creator says the bot may not be true AI, but it is a work of art.
This may shed some light on the where Strong AI actually stands.

"Experts in the field sometimes decry Sophia as emblematic of AI hype, and say that although the bot is presented as being a few software updates away from human-level consciousness, it’s more about illusion than intelligence."

"For Ben Goertzel, chief scientist at Hanson Robotics, the company that made Sophia, the situation is conflicting, to say the least. In interviews with The Verge, Goertzel said it was “not ideal” that some thought of Sophia as having artificial general intelligence or AGI (the industry term for human-equivalent intelligence) but, he acknowledged that the misconception did have its upsides."

And by upsides he meant this "For Ben Goertzel, chief scientist at Hanson Robotics, the company that made Sophia, the situation is conflicting, to say the least.

“What does a startup get out of having massive international publicity?” he says. “This is obvious.”
